# Repository Name: Language_Model_Test

## Description
This repository contains resources to test and experiment with the .csv conversion LLM. Specifically, it includes a Jupyter notebook designed to demonstrate the capabilities of the finetuned model. The notebook allows users to interact with the model, generate text, and explore its generalization ability on unseen data structures. 

## Contents

1. **Notebook:**
    - `generate_dataset.ipynb`: This Jupyter notebook serves as the main component of the repository. It provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the large language model, showcasing its text generation capabilities and language understanding.

2. **Modules:**
    - `infer.py`: Contains a class used to preprocess the csv to the right format and generate a target dataset from it.



## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```
    https://github.com/piegarroni/testing-LLM-csv-conversion-cense.git
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies using pip:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
